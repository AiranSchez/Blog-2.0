## Introduction

We've all wanted at some point in our career to be in contact with people who know a lot to have them as guides on the path, right? Well, I'm glad to let you know that you've found it.

Professionals and students come together in this community to carry out very varied activities that will surely interest you:

## Coding dojo

 The quintessential activity where we meet to practice programming methodologies to solve a specific paradigm. We always get together in pairs to start **practicing TDD** with established rules. After 30-40 minutes we get together as a group and discuss the approach that each pair has taken. Then we change partners and start from scratch again and, if possible, with a different approach. What is the purpose? To see **different ways** of doing the same exercise and **learn** from others as much as possible. It doesn't matter what level you have and what technology you use as long as you learn something new with each session.

## Book club

 Once a week we meet to discuss the different chapters of the books we're reading. We rotate a bit to make the reading enjoyable and not always on the same topic.

## Code review

 If during a coding dojo, class, or any event you have questions about the code you're working on, share your doubts with us in the general chat and we'll be happy to help. Or we can simply meet to talk about how to start that project you're so excited about.

## Blog post

 One of the main activities promoted at Lean Mind is personal development, so having an online notebook where anyone can see what you're learning is a good way to show the world what you know. Once a week we propose topics to write about and we develop them to get feedback from colleagues and help each other.

## LM Talks

 The professionals working at Lean Mind give us once a week a talk on some interesting topic or to show us the personal projects they've been working on lately.

## Open source projects

 We're currently working on Huella digital, a platform to help volunteers fight COVID-19. Every day we dedicate a few hours to working on this project and shaping it little by little. We hope in the future to continue working with projects like this to promote solidarity work and learning.

## Classes

 about basic or important topics on work methodologies, interesting technologies and even exercises that help us better understand programming languages. All of these are classes that Carlos Blé along with some Lean Mind workers provide us to help us better understand the most complex concepts at the beginning of our profession. All those classes are accessible on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW16ot2jRfF3LgUSCEiGd8g/videos) channel

## Recommendations

The things you can do in the community are not few and luckily we can choose those that interest us most. However, we understand that at first the amount of things to learn can be shocking, so we recommend that you don't try to cover everything at once.

If you don't know where to start, we **recommend the following**:

* **Create a blog** where you write what you learn, interesting things you find and small guides for yourself (or for whoever reads it) on how to do something. After that, share it with us to get to know you better.
* **Join the shared calendar** we have on Google Calendar. Send us your email address through the general chat so we can give you access to create events. [Lean Mind apprentices calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=6ka0n1aalvh1kuisi9eapm8ho0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FLondon).
* **Participate in the Katas** (Coding dojos), don't be afraid if you think you don't have the level, no one is born learned and the best way you're going to learn is by making mistakes. Besides, the atmosphere is very respectful and welcoming.
* **Propose activities** in the chat. We promote initiative and every proposal is accepted with open arms.
